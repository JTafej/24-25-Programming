# Welcome to the intro to programming GitHub page! 

## This post is meant to give you an idea of the typical structure of the course. 

### Often, there will be a short lesson, with some code that you are meant to copy into Replit to experiment with. 

### For today, please open Replit, create an account (with your school email) and create a new Python file. 

#### Please copy and paste the following code into Replit, and hit "Run"! (You can copy by clicking the clipboard to the right of the code.)
```
print("hello everyone!")
```
#### Congrats! This is called a Print statement. You just ran your first program! Please take note of the Syntax, as it is all important. The quotes, print is lowercase, the parenthesis.

#### Now for something more. Say you want to store some information in your program. For example, your name. We can do this with something called a variable. See example below. Notice the additional syntax, and try this with your own name! 

```
name = "Jacob"
print("Hello", name)
```
#### Finally, we want to have some kind of interaction with the user. We will use an input command. You will need to type your name directly into the console, and then the computer will spit out Hello Yourname. 

```
you = input("What is your name?")

print("Hello", you)
```
#### 

### Now, this is the part of the post where there is typically a "Daily Challenge." Please complete the following challenge and show me when you have a working program. We will talk about how submissions will work next class, but for now, you will just show me. 

#### Your challenge for today is to ask for 4 variables from a user, and then use those variables to write a few sentence story. You can decide what the variables are. For example, you could ask for fruits, and explain how to make a pie using all the fruits that the user inputs. Please show me when you are finished with this project. Have fun!
#### If you need an extra challenge, try making a madlibs game. If you need a harder challenge, try making an empty list, and adding inputs to it from the user. (You may need to do some research for this...)
