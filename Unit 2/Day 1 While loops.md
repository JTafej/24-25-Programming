### You're in for a treat! Today we are talking about While loops. We will learn about other loops later, but you will soon discover that loops are a very powerful tool in programming. 

#### So what is a while loop? It is a way to run a program over and over again until a certain condition is met.

#### For example, try running the following code that was demonstrated by our brave volunteer. 

```
counter = 0
while counter < 10:
  print(counter)
  counter +=1
```
#### You will see that the code will run until counter = 10. Amazing. Can you make the program count to 100 instead? 

##### Try running this code. What happens? 
```
exit = ""
while exit = "yes":
  print("ðŸ¥³")
exit = input("Exit?: ")
```

  Ah! The "Exit" question was not IN the while loop in that code. Add an indent to the exit line to correct the loop.

### So, what is so useful about while loops? Let's compare an example of code that uses conditionals vs code that does the same thing but uses a while loop: 

#### In this first example, you manually check if each number from 1 to 5 is less than 5 using if statements. This is repetitive and inefficient for larger tasks.
```
# Using if statements
number = 1

if number < 5:
    print(f"{number} is less than 5")

number = 2
if number < 5:
    print(f"{number} is less than 5")

number = 3
if number < 5:
    print(f"{number} is less than 5")

number = 4
if number < 5:
    print(f"{number} is less than 5")

number = 5
if number < 5:
    print(f"{number} is less than 5")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not less than 5")
```
#### In this second example, a while loop automates the task by repeatedly checking the condition without needing to write multiple if statements. This makes the code cleaner and more scalable.

```
# Using a while loop
number = 1

while number <= 5:
    if number < 5:
        print(f"{number} is less than 5")
    else:
        print(f"{number} is not less than 5")
    number += 1  # increment the number to avoid an infinite loop
```
### In case it is not already clear, here are a few reasons why while loops are more valuable: 
* Reusability: With the while loop, you can easily change the range or condition, and it will automatically apply without rewriting the logic multiple times.
* Scalability: The if statements become cumbersome for large ranges (e.g., from 1 to 100), while the loop handles such cases with minimal code changes.
* Maintenance: If you need to update the condition (e.g., check numbers less than 10 instead of 5), you only need to change the condition in one place when using a loop. With if statements, you'd need to update each condition manually.

### Finally, one of the most powerful ways to use a while use is with a Boolean. [Read about Booleans here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type). This will run until you tell the while loop to "break," which will end the while loop. Try running this program and notice the use of "counter." You will need to use a counter for your challenge today. 
```
print("can you guess the lyrics??\n Guess the lyrics. If you get them right, you can be cool\n")
counter = 0
while True:

  guess = input("Never going to ____ you up \n Guess:")
  
 
  counter += 1
  if guess == "give":
    break
  print("Try again!")
print("Nice! You got it on attempt number", counter)

```

#### The challenge for today is to create a program that asks the user for an animal, and then says the sound that animal makes. For example: "what animal do you like?" if input = cow, output is "Cows go mooooo" Please use a while loop so you can ask a user if they want to keep playing the game. If they say no, make sure you stop the game. 
*Add a counter to your program, and tell you user how many rounds they played after they exit.*
