### Programming Project 2.
Hello! Today you will be embarking on the great journey of Programming Project #2. Good projects start with a good idea. We will spend some time in class today talking about what we have learned so far, and uncovering the potential we have to create amazing things already. 
Let’s start with a simple list of some things we have talked about so far. Work with your group to write down as many terms as you can remember, along with a brief explanation of what that thing does. 
For example: 
-	Print(“hello”) <- Basic print statement. This will print the string “hello” . Print can also be used with variables. We also talk about printing f-strings…. 
#### Your list:

#### Now we have developed a list of what we know. Let’s generate some ideas for projects. These should be projects that you think you could finish coding in 3 class periods. Not too complex, and not too simple. They should include most of what you put on the list above, and may include additional libraries, data structures, or something else that you think would improve the functionality. Lastly, the three ideas you think of here should be distinct from one another. So you can’t list 3 different text adventure games, for example. You will get points for class today by generating these 3 ideas.
