# Welcome to class number 2! Today we will review print(), variables, and strings. We will also talk about concatenating and if/else statements. 

## First of all, please read through the powerpoint on Canvas if you have not already. Here is a relevant slide:

## I hope you enjoyed the ice cream introduction to if statements. Here is an example of code that mimics what the volunteer was doing in class today. Notice the indentation and colon use. It is all important. 

```
flavor = input("What's you favorite flavor of ice cream?")
if flavor == "cookies and cream":
  print("high five!")
else:
  print("Ew!")
```



## Use the code above as a starting place for your challenge today. You need to create a program that asks a user for their name. If their name is the same as yours, you should print them a nice, concatenated note. Otherwise, print a message that says something like "ALERT!"
