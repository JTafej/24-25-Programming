# Welcome to class number 2! Today we will review print(), variables, and strings. We will also talk about concatenating and if/else statements. 

## First of all, please read through the powerpoint on Canvas if you have not already. Here is a relevant slide:

## I hope you enjoyed the ice cream introduction to if-else statements. Here is an example of code that mimics what the volunteer was doing in class today. Notice the indentation and colon use. It is all important. 

```
flavor = input("What's you favorite flavor of ice cream?")
if flavor == "cookies and cream":
  print("high five!")
else:
  print("Ew!")
```

## You can also use if statements to compare the values of integers (aka whole numbers). See example below, and mess around with it. Add an "else" statement for other cases and show me when you have that done. 

```
a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
```


## Use the ice cream code above as a starting place for your challenge today. 
* You need to create a program that asks a user for their name.
* If their name is the same as yours, you should print them a nice, concatenated note.
* Otherwise, print a message that says something like "ALERT!"

* (Not required) Need an extra challenge? Ask them a follow up question after confirming they have the same name as you. (Be careful with indentation here. It may be helpful to read about "nested if statements" [Nested if Statements](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_if_nested.asp)
