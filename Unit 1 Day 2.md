# Welcome to class number 2! Today we will review print(), variables, and strings. We will also talk about concatenating and if statements. 

## First of all, please read through the powerpoint on Canvas if you have not already. Here is a relevant slide:

## I hope you enjoyed the ice cream introduction to if statements. Here is an example of code that mimics what the volunteer was doing in class today. Notice the indentation and colon use. It is all important. 

flavor = input("What's you favorite flavor of ice cream?")
if flavor == "cookies and cream":
  print("high five!")
else:
  print("Ew!")



## Your challenge for today is to use the following starter code on https://www.online-python.com/ to create a number guessing game. Instead of b > a, you'll need to check if they are equal with two equal signs: a == b. 
```
a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
```
