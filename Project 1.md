## Project 1. September 16th, 2024. Today you will begin your first project. I am sorry I will not be there to walk you through it today. Please read this document thoroughly and make sure you follow the guidelines listed below for full credit. 

#### **Overview**
For your first Python programming project, you'll be using what you've learned about **conditionals (if, else, elif)**, **int and float**, **basic math**, **variables**, and **print statements** to create a small, interesting program. The goal is to challenge yourself to think creatively about how you can use these basic tools to build something fun and functional.

Your project can be a simple game, a story generator, or any interactive program that meets the requirements below. Some examples to consider are:
- **Rock Paper Scissors**: Build a game where the user plays against the computer. It should handle all situations!
- **Madlibs**: Create a fun fill-in-the-blank word game.
- **Adventure Game**: Write a simple text-based adventure where the user makes choices that affect the outcome. Try to add something to make this new, since you have already done one text adventure game. 
- **Tic Tac Toe**: Create a basic version of Tic Tac Toe using print statements to display the board. 

#### **Project Requirements**
Your project must include:
1. **Conditionals (if, else, elif):** You should use at least one if-else structure and include an elif statement to control the flow of your program.
2. **Variables:** You need to use variables to store information (e.g., player choices, game outcomes, or inputs).
3. **Math of some kind:** This could be very basic, like comparing an input to a different number. Think about the "math" we did last week. 
4. **Print Statements:** Use print statements to display information to the user and make your program interactive.
5. **Comments:** Include comments in your code to explain what each section is doing (at least 3 comments).

#### **What You'll Submit**
You will submit your Python file (.py) which includes your project code. Make sure your program runs without errors and is easy to follow.

#### **Grading**
Your project will be graded on:
- Use of conditionals, variables, and print statements
- Clear and organized code with comments
- Creativity and effort put into the project
- Functionality (your program should run without errors)
